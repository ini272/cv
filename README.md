# Professinal Experience

**DevOps Engineer**
*RISE | Visual Effects Studios*
*05/2023 - present*

- Utilizing GitLab pipelines for testing and deployment processes for various infrastructure services like static DHCP records, reverse proxy configuration, and standalone web applications
- Developing multiple Ansible roles to establish a solid infrastructure foundation, including tasks such as server enrollment to identity domains, metrics aggregation with Telegraf, repository access management, and proxy configuration
- Consolidated web application components into a single Docker Compose file, integrating Nginx, API services, and application layers for improved deployment efficiency and system manageability

**System Administrator**
*RISE | Visual Effects Studios*
*02/2017 – 11/2018, 05/2019 – 04/2023*

- Managing the company's ~1K Linux workstations and render nodes using Puppet
to keep the desired system state and Kickstart files for provisioning, thus 
automating IP address management, DNS records, and enrollment to the identity
management system
- Racked up and deployed physical nodes in the local data center serving as virtual workstations (VMs) to meet
the demand for remote work
- Monitoring critical server resource utilization using InfluxDB and Grafana for
virtualization, furthermore ingesting data from several PDUs in the local server
room, throwing alerts upon reaching certain limits
- Lead the transition from the main storage cluster using BeeGFS to a more
performant and redundant solution using GPFS, in collaboration with an external
vendor
- Introduced a high availability cluster hosting infrastructure services using Ceph as
the distributed file system and Proxmox as the hypervisor, deprecating the former
single node VirtualBox hosts, therefore increasing redundancy, eliminating a
single point of failure, and providing a path for OS and software updates with low
downtime
- Onboarded new IT colleagues: Informing them about ticketing procedures,
location-specific servers, configuration management, etc.


**System Administrator - Internship**
*Storm Postproduction B.V*
*12/2018 – 04/2019*
- Installed and maintained the hardware and network infrastructure of new office
space including the setup of physical workstations, basic Linux file server, local
switch, subnet configuration, and a VPN tunnel to the main office network
