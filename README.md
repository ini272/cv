- Utilizing GitLab pipelines for testing and deployment processes for various infrastructure services like static DHCP records, reverse proxy configuration, and standalone web applications
- Developing multiple Ansible roles to create a foundation for deploying new servers, including tasks such as server enrollment to identity domains, metrics aggregation using Telegraf, and repository access
- Unifying web application components with Docker, integrating Nginx, API services, and application layers for better system manageability
